# Modularity: Each class is designed to be modular, allowing for independent development and testing.
# Integration Points: The run_theorem_proving and optimize_logical_paths methods in the AIInferenceSystem class serve as integration points for the new features.
# Placeholder Methods: The actual implementation of algorithms like set-of-support strategy, linear resolution, and pathfinding should be developed within the respective placeholder methods.
# Scalability and Performance: As the implementation becomes more complex, special attention should be given to performance optimization and scalability, especially in the theorem-proving process.
